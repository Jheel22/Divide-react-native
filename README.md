[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is a free and open source framework that enables developers to build high-quality apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for iOS and Android with a fusion of ES6. NativeBase builds a layer on top of React Native that provides you with basic set of components for mobile application development. This helps you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms.
